and ask about things that are already well explained. This unfortunately keeps happening.</string>
    <string name="text_PBD">Path of Building is a tool that lets you fully plan characters from scratch, check out other peoples setups or import your own character to check DPS and defenses or compare potential upgrades.\n<a href="https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/releases">Path of Building Community Fork</a> (<b><i>required for the POB above</i></b>)\n<a href="https://imgur.com/OeTuAhL">How to import builds</a></string>

    <string name="text_mech"><b>‣ Chaining:</b> Arc is a lightning-based spell with the ability to chain from monsters and destroyable objects, even around corners and out of your line of sight! Each time it chains, it will also split to
a second nearby enemy from where it can\'t chain further. The amount of times Arc can chain depends on its gem level and can be increased by enchantments.
        \n\n‣ <b>Mana:</b> By default, mana is used to cover skill costs and -reservation. This build however couples heavy mana investment with several gems and keystones for various offensive and defensive purposes. Mind over Matter redirects 30% of the damage we take to our life to mana instead while the Agnostic spends mana to heal our life back to full, the gems will be covered later in the guide. This makes our mana investment very efficient and augments the value of the base 6 mana we gain per level, but it also creates a high demand for sustain beyond the base 1.8% of mana being regenerated per second which we mostly cover through our ascendancy, flasks and passives.
        \n\n‣ <b>Block:</b> Another defensive layer which comes in two ways, Chance to Block Attacks and Chance to Block Spells, each with a base cap of 75%. Blocking hits prevents all damage and status effects except for stun, however non-hitbased damage over time can\'t be blocked. While we won\'t reach the block cap, it\'s still enough damage prevention coupled with some ways to heal us on block.
        \n\n‣ <b>Elemental Overload:</b> This keystone provides a 40% more damage multiplier in exchange for removing all critical strike multiplier, with the condition to crit atleast once within 8 seconds. While the damage potential is lower compared to scaling crits, the damage is also way more consistent and only takes small investment, which allows us to invest more heavily into mana.
        \n\n‣ <b>Spiritual Aid:</b> A notable that applies all stats with the wording \"Minions deal #% increased Damage\" and \"Minions deal #% reduced Damage\" to our damage. This gives some more liberties while gearing and makes said stat from our ascendancy not go to waste. Note that minion damage stats with different wording, such as \"Golems deal #% increased Damage\", \"Minions deal #% more Damage\" or \"Minions deal # to # additional Lightning Damage\" won\'t apply to us!</string>
<string name="text_lvl1">Here\'s a small collection of generic advice for newer players:\n\n
<b>‣ Information:</b> Knowledge is a strong skill in Path of Exile, and it helps to know where to find it. First there\'s the ingame Help Panel, which you can reach through its icon next to your skillbar.
The Path of Exile Wiki should be your first stop for further information, poedb for plain data.
Lastly, Engineering Eternity has a youtube channel with lots of informative videos.\n\n

<b>‣ Lootfilter:</b> You will soon realize that there\'s lots of redundant loot in this game, a good Lootfilter reduces screen clutter and highlights potentially valuable or important drops. Neversink\'s Filter is always a good start and you can further customize it at Filterblade.\n\n

<b>‣ Flasks:</b> Unlike most ARPG\'s, this game is directly balanced around using all your flasks.
This goes beyond the typical life and mana flasks that you\'re probably used to from other games, during your act progression you\'ll gain access to various utility flasks which grant powerful buffs. Flasks can also be crafted, but it\'s not needed until maps so i\'ve kept it for their own flask section. For now, focus on keeping your life and mana flasks updated, get all utility flasks from quests when mentioned and try to get a feeling for your flask usage.\n\n

<b>‣ Crafting:</b> Gear can be enhanced in various ways through crafting and recipes, while the latter can also create currency used for crafting. You outlevel gear pretty quickly during act progression, so it\'s not advised to invest too much at this point. Limit it to Orbs of Transmutation, Orbs of Augmentation, Orbs of Alteration, Chromatic Orbs and various Essences you can find for now,
use Jeweller\'s Orbs and Orbs of Fusing only on useful gear you\'ve looted. Try to focus on intelligence-based gear for an easier time to get the right colors.\n\n

<b>‣ Crafting Bench:</b> After unlocking your first hideout, you\'ll gain access to the Crafting Bench.
This can be used to craft a targeted affix on gear, if it isn\'t already there and has a slot available. Use it to craft any damage affixes, Life, Attributes or Elemental Resistances missing on your gear.
Recipes need to be found first, the Crafting Bench tells you all undiscovered recipe locations.\n\n

<b>‣ Trading:</b> You can freely trade with other players if you have a Lv25+ char and aren\'t in SSF. Path of Exile\'s own trading site is good for buying gear, poemap is convenient for bulk map trades. If you want to sell something, you either need premium stash tabs, set up a shop in the trade subforums or use Acquisition. For pricechecks, look for similar stuff on the trade site, check poe.ninja or use Awakened POE Trade.\n\n

<b>‣ Stash Tabs:</b> The default stash space is pretty limited, if you like the game and are able to, consider buying more stash tabs. Getting a Currency- and Map Tab is highly recommended, Premium Tabs make trading easier and if you want, a Quad Tab makes a good dump tab.
Purchased tabs are account-wide, you won\'t lose them when temporary leagues end.
There\'s also a stash tab sale weekend each month, wait for that if you\'re not in a rush.</string>
    <string name="text_lvl2">Your journey through the ten acts can be seen as an extensive tutorial, slowly confronting you with the majority of game mechanics and increasingly more difficult enemies to learn to counter.\n\n

This section will help you while playing through the ten acts and shows the recommended
passive tree progression, gem setups, quest progression and exp farming zone for each act.
The passive tree goals are just a pointer, it\'s not a big deal if you\'re over- or underleveled.\n\n

    <string name="text_asc2"><b>Ascendancy</b> <b>Essence Glutton</b> <i>(Normal)</i>: The main reason why we choose Necromancer. Provides tons of mana sustain with the right setup, and even some extra mana on top of that. 
        <b>Mistress of Sacrifice</b> <i>(Cruel)</i>: Another reason for Necromancer. Applies offerings to us with slightly lowered effect and increases skill duration. 
        <b>Plaguebringer</b> <i>(Merciless)</i>: Reduces enemy damage while increasing our damage output and provides some AoE, as long as there are corpses nearby and we\'ve consumed one. 
        <b>Corpse Pact</b> <i>(Eternal)</i>: Shocks enemies for another 15% increased damage taken, chills them for 10% reduced action speed and gives us some damage and cast speed.</string>
<string name="text_asc3"><b>Pantheon</b>

‣ <b>Soul of the Brine King</b> <i>(Major)</i>: Prevents us from getting stunlocked and shortens stun duration.

‣ <b>Soul of Tukohama</b> <i>(Minor)</i>: Additional physical damage mitigation and life regeneration.

‣ <b>Soul of Ryslatha</b> <i>(Minor)</i>: Life Flask sustain for longer bossfights.

<i>You can have 1x major and 1x minor Pantheon node active at once.</i></string>
<string name="text_gem1"><i>Non-corrupted Lv20 Gems can be upgraded to Lv1 20% by vendoring them together with a Gemcutters Prism. Do this with all gems that are marked with a *\n\n

All gems are worth corrupting at Lv20 20%, for the ones not needing quality just do it at Lv20.\n\n

Any Awakened Gem versions of listed support gems are worth using.</i>

<b>Arc</b> is our main skill - it has high base damage, decent cast time and a more damage modifier for each remaining chain. This simply means that if for example your Arc can chain 7x and there\'s nothing to chain to, it will get a 105% (7*15%) more damage multiplier for that hit.

We can also use Vaal Arc, which grants both the regular Arc skill and a buffed up Vaal Arc that grants us the Lucky Buff. This buff counters our high lightning damage range by rolling each damage roll twice and taking the higher one. However, it can still happen that it rolls two low values and you end up getting a few small hits.

To help with this decision, a Lv21 Arc is always better than a Lv20 Vaal Arc. Since Vaal Arc is corrupted by default, the only reliable way to get it at Lv21 is using the Lapidary Lense on an uncorrupted Lv20 Arc gem in the Temple of Atzoatl, although it\'s not a guaranteed outcome.

<b>Archmage*</b> increases our mana cost and adds flat lightning damage based on mana cost at 80% value because of Arcs damage effectiveness. This synergizes extremely well with mana stacking and makes up the majority of our damage, but also creates a huge demand for sustain.
<b>Spell Echo*</b> substantially boosts our cast speed and repeats each skill use without consuming mana for the repeated cast, all at the cost of a minimal damage penalty.
<b>Lightning Penetration*</b> is a hidden damage increase - it doesn\'t affect our tooltip damage, but rather acts as a dynamic more multiplier by reducing the enemies lightning resistance during damage calculations, and can even drop it into negative values.

5th Link: <b>Elemental Focus*</b> provides a huge damage multiplier but removes the ability to inflict ailments with the linked skill, but not other sources such as from Corpse Pact.

6th Link: <b>Controlled Destruction*</b> gives another damage multiplier with a crit chance penalty. The distinction between "less" and "reduced" is important, 100% less would mean we\'d lose all crit chance while 100% reduced means it\'s additive with all "increased crit chance" multipliers.


<b>Orb of Storms*</b> is a duration-based spell that we use for some extra damage during bossfights. It releases bolts at enemies within its radius, plus additional bolts if we cast a lightning skill such as Arc while within its radius. This also makes it a great skill to proc Elemental Overload with.

<b>Archmage*, Lightning Penetration*</b> and <b>Elemental Focus*</b> are explained above.


<b>Arcane Cloak*</b> spends a percentage of our mana and temporarily grants us a damage absorbing buff and flat lightning damage based on mana spent. This is great for extra burst damage during bossfights or to soak up some incoming damage.

<b>Arcane Surge</b> grants a temporary buff after spending a certain amount of mana, which grants a more damage multiplier, cast speed and mana regeneration. Since Arcane Cloak spends lots of mana, we can proc a max level Arcane Surge within a single skill use.
<b>Increased Duration*</b> increased both buff durations.
<b>Second Wind*</b> slightly reduces Arcane Cloaks cooldown to help with uptime during bossfights.


<b>Clarity</b> is an aura that grants mana regeneration to help with sustain. Unlike most other auras, it reserves a flat amount of mana based on its level. We simply level it all the way up, which also prevents it to interfere with the next gems.

<b>Cast when Damage taken</b> triggers linked spells after receiving enough damage from hits to surpass the listed treshold. The spells also need to have their required level within the listed level requirement. In this case, we simply keep everything at Lv1.
<b>Tempest Shield</b> grants additional Chance to Block Attacks and Chance to Block Spells.
Its damaging aspect isn\'t important for us, so we simply keep it at Lv1.
<b>Wave of Conviction</b> debuffs enemies with Exposure based on its highest elemental damage.
It deals base physical damage with inherent 25% Fire and 25% Lightning Conversion, with any Lightning Damage to Spells or -multiplier on gear we can ensure to get Lightning Exposure.
To stay safe from physical reflect and keep the skill within proc restrictions, we keep it at Lv1.

Verified

<b>Arcanist Brand*</b> triggers linked spells while being attached to an enemy. We simply use it for utility to gain various buffs during bossfights, or whenever else it\'s needed. Eventually we aim to replace this gems purpose with a weapon craft, which will be mentioned later in the guide.

<b>Desecrate</b> spawns 5 corpses on use, with a maximum of 10. These are needed for Essence Glutton, Plaguebringer and Corpse Pact from our ascendancy and the following gem. We don\'t gain anything from leveling it, so we keep it at Lv1 for low dexterity requirements.
<b>Bone Offering*</b> grants us a large amount of Chance to Block Attacks and Chance to Block Spells, and recovers a flat amount of life when we block.


<b>Flame Dash*</b> is our movement skill of choice, it has three uses and a short cooldown. Additionally, it removes Grasping Vines and prevents us from taking damage from stationary damage over time sources when dashing through.

<b>Second Wind*</b> adds another use to Flame Dash and reduces its cooldown.
<b>Arcane Surge</b> was explained earlier already, just this time we want to use a lower level gem to still gain a minor Arcane Surge buff while Arcane Cloak wasn\'t used. Keep it at Lv6 this time, or Lv7 if you have the Forethought notable already.</string>
